## Overview

"binomial" is an R package that provides functions for calculating probabilities of a Binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the probability distribution, the expected value, variance, etc.

check_prob() to check validity of prob value.
check_trials() to check validity of trials value.
check_success() to check validity of success value.
aux_mean(), auxillary function to calculate mean.
aux_variance(), auxillary function to calculate variance.
aux_mode(), auxillary function to calculate mode.
aux_skewness(), auxillary function to calculate skewness.
aux_kurtosis(), auxillary function to calculate kurtosis.
bin_choose() to calculate number of compliations in which k successes can occur in n trials.
bin_probability() to calculate probability of success in a number of trials.
bin_distribution() to create a data frame of a binomial probability distribution.
bin_cumulative() to create a data frame of a binomial cumulative distribution.
plot() method for a "binvar" object.
summary() method for a "binvar" object.
print() method for a "binvar" or "summary.binvar" object.
